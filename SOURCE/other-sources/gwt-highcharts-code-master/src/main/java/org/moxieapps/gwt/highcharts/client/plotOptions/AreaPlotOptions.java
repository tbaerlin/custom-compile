/**
 * Represents the general plot options available for all area type series, which can be set either generically
 * on the chart via the {@link Chart#setAreaPlotOptions(AreaPlotOptions)} )} method or directly on a
 * series via the {@link Series#setPlotOptions(PlotOptions)} method.
 * <p/>
 * Note that these options are only needed if you want to specifically control the general options
 * for all area type series in the entire chart.  If you instead want to control the options for all
 * series in the chart (not just those of an area type), then you can use the {@link SeriesPlotOptions}
 * class instead.  Or, if you want to control the plot options for just one series (and not all area type
 * series in the chart), use the {@link org.moxieapps.gwt.highcharts.client.Series#setPlotOptions(PlotOptions)} method.
