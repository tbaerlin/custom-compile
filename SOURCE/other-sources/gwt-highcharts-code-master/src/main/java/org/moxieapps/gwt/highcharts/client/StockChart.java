/**
 * BETA!  The main GWT widget that can be constructed and then configured in order to add a Highstock
 * chart into a GWT layout container.  Note that for more basic chart types just make use of the
 * {@link Chart} widget instead.
 * Basic usage is as follows:
 * <pre><code>
 * StockChart stockChart = new StockChart()
 *    .setChartTitleText("NYSE")
 *    .setMarginRight(10);
 * Series series = stockChart.createSeries()
 *   .addPoint(40)
 *   .addPoint(35)
 *   .addPoint(60);
 * stockChart.addSeries(series);
 * RootPanel.get().add(stockChart);
 * </code></pre>
 * For details on available options see the <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/ref/">Highcharts reference</a>.
 * <p/>
 * Note that in order for this widget to function you must have included the Highstock javascript
 * library and any of its dependencies in the page that the widget will run inside of.  E.g.:
 * <pre><code>
 * &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 * &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js/highstock.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 * </code></pre><pre><code>
 * &lt;!-- Optionally, add a highcharts theme file --&gt;
 * &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js/themes/gray.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 * </code></pre><pre><code>
 * &lt;!-- Optionally, include the highcharts exporting module --&gt;
 * &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js/modules/exporting.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 * </code></pre>
 * Note that the "highstock.js" file includes all of the capabilities of the "highcharts.js" file.
 * So if you plan on using both {@link StockChart}'s and regular {@link Chart}'s simultaneously, then
 * you only need to include the "highstock.js" file in your page.
 * <p/>
 * Also note that Highcharts supports other JS frameworks besides jQuery for its internal DOM manipulation
 * functionality.  So, if jQuery isn't your cup of tea check the
 * <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/documentation/how-to-use#installation">installation docs</a>
 * on the Highcharts site for more details.
