/**
 * Manages a data series (and its options) that can then be added to a {@link org.moxieapps.gwt.highcharts.client.Chart}.  As an extension
 * of {@link org.moxieapps.gwt.highcharts.client.Configurable} each series instance can also optionally have configuration options set on it.
 * In order to create a new series, utilize the {@link org.moxieapps.gwt.highcharts.client.Chart#createSeries()} method, configure it, add data
 * to it, and then add it to the chart via the {@link org.moxieapps.gwt.highcharts.client.Chart#addSeries(org.moxieapps.gwt.highcharts.client.Series)} method.  Note that a series
 * can be modified after the chart has been rendered as well, which allows for support of dynamic charts or series
 * that change in some way based on user behavior.  Simple example of setting up a series on a chart:
 * <code><pre>
 * Series series = chart.createSeries()
 *   .setName("Random Stuff")
 *   .addPoint(40)
 *   .addPoint(35)
 *   .addPoint(60);
 * chart.addSeries(series);
 * </pre></code>
 * Example of updating all of the points in a series at once:
 * <code><pre>
 * chart.addSeries(chart.createSeries()
 *   .setName("Random Stuff")
 *   .setPoints(new Number[] { 40, 35, 60 })
 * );
 * </pre></code>
 * Example of changing the options for one point in the series:
 * <code><pre>
 * chart.addSeries(chart.createSeries()
 *   .setName("Random Stuff")
 *   .addPoint(40)
 *   .addPoint(new Point(35).setColor("#BF0B23"))
 *   .addPoint(60)
 * );
 * </pre></code>
