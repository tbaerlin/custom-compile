<h3>chicago2</h3>
The old chicago system ("chicago2") used a feed very similar to the mdps feed:
Each message contains a number of fields that consist of a short (2byte)
field-id and the respective field value, there is no guaranteed order of those fields
in a message. This format is suboptimal for a number of reasons:
<ul>
    <li>There are more than 2000 field-ids and fields with high update frequencies are
    scattered all over that range.</li>
    <li>When fields are stored in {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.snap.SnapDataDefault}
        objects, an auxiliary structure is needed to be able to figure out at which
    position in a byte[] a particular field is stored: {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.snap.IndexAndOffset}
    </li>
    <li>While at first the ratio between SnapData to shared IndexAndOffset instances was
    large, more and more fields reduced that ratio to s.th. like 12:1,
        that is 700000 IAOs for 9Mio Snaps.</li>
    <li>Feed processing requires frequent method calls on Fields in
    {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.vwd.VwdFieldDescription} to infer types and lengths
    of the valious fields.</li>
    <li>The memory access pattern is nowhere near linear, so performance suffers</li>
</ul>
Other problems with chicago2 include the following:
<ul>
    <li>Storing snap data in memory as well as in mysql (static fields) is awkward.</li>
    <li>Encoding and decoding of tick data is extremely complicated, yet cannot be
    extended since all the available bits have been used up {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.tick.TickEncoder},
    {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.tick.TickDecoder}</li>
    <li>Storing all ticks in many small chunks (128 or 256 bytes) and storing
    a huge amount of tick data whenever the number of free tick chunks becomes too low
    put a lot of stress on the memory bus at certain times</li>
</ul>

The {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.ordered.OrderedFeedBuilder} converts the mdps feed
into a multicast feed that is ordered. The field-order is determined based on update
frequency and the need to store certain fields as tick data (see {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.vwd.VwdFieldOrder}),
which is generated by {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.vwd.VwdFieldDescriptionGenerator}.
<p>
{@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.ordered.OrderedSnapDataImpl} stores the snap fields in the
    same way as they appear in the feed and that can be seen in
    {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.ordered.FieldDataBuilder}. The nice thing about the ordered feed
is that updates can be performed by merging the current snap data with the incoming update similar
to a merge sort (see {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.ordered.FieldDataMerger}).
<p>
    Tick data is also stored as ordered fields {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.ordered.tick.TickBuilder},
    in chunks of various sizes {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.ordered.tick.MemoryTickStore} and
    will be compressed using snappy when chunks are written to a tick file. Chunks are scheduled
    for writing as soon as they are full and a new chunk is allocated. As in chicago2, tick chunks
    are stored off the heap in direct ByteBuffers.
