<h3>What is Tick Data?</h3>
Tick data is comprised of the set of fields for which every single update is stored (as opposed
to snap data, for which only the latest update is stored). In addition to common tick fields (those
with an order id less than {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.vwd.VwdFieldOrder#FIRST_NON_TICK} and
not skipped by {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.ordered.tick.TickBuilder#addTickFields}), market
specific tick fields with larger order ids are defined in {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.vwd.MarketTickFields}.
<p>
The detection of whether an update contains ticks is performed by an instance of
    {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.vwd.TickTypeCheckerVwd}, wich usually runs in the
    <tt>istar-multicast-mdps</tt> process and adds tick flags (see {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.FeedUpdateFlags})
    to multicasted feed records. The receiving processes just reuse those flags
    (see {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.TickTypeCheckerByFlags}). So whenever the set of tick
    fields changes, both <tt>istar-multicast-mdps</tt> and <tt>istar-chicago3</tt> have to be
    updated, the former to add the correct flags, the latter to store the corresponding fields when
    the received flags tell it to do so.
</p>
<h3>How is Tick Data stored?</h3>
Tick data is stored by a {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.ordered.tick.TickBuilder}, which collects
tick fields in a local ByteBuffer and then tells a {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.ordered.tick.MemoryTickStore}
to add this tick record for the given <tt>FeedData</tt> object. This, in turn, will modify fields
of the {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.ordered.tick.OrderedTickData} object stored in the
<tt>(Ordered)FeedData</tt> object.
<p>
As not all ticks for a day can be stored in memory, the <tt>MemoryTickStore</tt> will submit full
tick chunks to a {@link de.marketmaker.istar.feed.ordered.tick.TickWriter} which asynchronously
appends ticks to tick files.
