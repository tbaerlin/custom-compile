  <h1>pm[web] interface description</h1>
  <h2>Integration</h2>
  The vwd portfolio manager [web] can be embedded into another html page by using an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> (see line 111).

  After the iframe is loaded, the JavaScript connection to pm[web] can be established, which is done using the parameter <code>onload="initialize()"</code>.

  The iframe is embedded into a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>  tag, so the size can be set with CSS.
  
  <h2>Init</h2>
  line 21-39: the method <code>initialize()</code> defines callback methods, which are called by pm[web] in its init routine.
  The following callback methods need to be defined:
  
  <h3><code>mmModuleLoadCallback()</code></h3>
  As soon as the pm[web] code is completely loaded, <code>mmModuleLoadCallback()</code> is called.
  Now the method <code>mmLogin(username, password)</code> can be called.
  
  <h3><code>mmErrorCallback(message)</code></h3>
  In case of init errors an error message is sent to this callback method.
  
  <h3><code>mmInitializedCallback()</code></h3>
  <p>
  After a successful login the pm[web] method <code>mmShowReport(inputObject, report)</code> can be used.
  Reports in pm[web] can only be rendered after this callback has been called.
  The button for showing reports (line 107) is initially disabled (<code>disabled="disabled"</code>) and is enabled by the callback in line 35.
  </p>
  <p>
  The callback methods are given to pm[web] in line 38 with the statement
  <code>initializeCallbackFunctions(mmModuleLoadCallback, mmErrorCallback, mmInitializedCallback)</code>.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Showing a report</h2>
  <p>
  A report can be shown after successful init with the method
  <code>mmShowReport(inputObject, report)</code>.
  <code>inputObject</code> is the input object like group, holder, portfolio, account or depot.
  The tuple contains id, object type and name (delimited with "|").
  The fourth parameter is optional and can describe an evaluation zone (probably not relevant for a PoC).
  Without a zone, the default zone "PUBLIC" is used. Samples for input objects are given in line 62-94.
  </p>
  <p>
  The parameter <code>report</code> specifies the report to be shown.
  Samples are given in line 99-104.

  Not every report can be used for each <code>inputObject</code> type.
  The characters GIPDK show which report is available for each respective input object type (abbreviation in german letters; group, holder (Inhaber), portfolio, depot, account (Konto)).
