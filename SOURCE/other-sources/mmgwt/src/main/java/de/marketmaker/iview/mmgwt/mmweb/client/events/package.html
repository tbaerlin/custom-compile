Contains events, their handlers, and associated implementations.
<h2>EventBus</h2>
The EventBus is a central event dispatching mechanism that helps
to decouple components.
<p>
    Example: PlaceChangeEvents are used to request that the application
    changes from one page to another. Instead of using History.newItem(...),
    we use eventBus.fireEvent(new PlaceChangeEvent(...)).
    The nice thing about this is that we no longer depend on History
    directly (which cannot appear in unit tests), a single component
    is responsible for interacting with History (HistoryPlaceManager)
</p>
<p>
    Ultimate goal is to get rid of PropertyChangeSupport and use
    gwt's HandlerManager concept instead. The EventBus is the
    global HandlerManager for application wide events. If you just
    need to couple some snippets, a local HandlerManager would be
    more appropriate.
</p>
<p>
    For each type of event, we need an Event-class and an associated
    Handler-interface. The Event-class usually
    <tt>extends GwtEvent&lt;<em>Handler-interface</em></tt>,
    the Handler-interface <tt>extends EventHandler</tt> and usually
    provides a single method that will be invoked in the event's
    dispatch method.
